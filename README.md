# README

## Problem Statement: 

Complete the resume/ CV app using Ruby on Rails.

## Features:

- Sign Up
- Add Profile Image
- Add other sections like skills, experience & etc
- Share live URL 

## Time-Stamps of my task:

- Day 1 - Jan 7 - Watched freecodecamps video on Ruby on Rails because I did not have any idea how ruby on rails work before and hence decided to give it a shot 
- Day 2 & 3- Jan 8 / Jan 9 - Cloned the repo and i thought it would run as I have installed ruby & rails on my computer but it did not and it wasted my time completely for the next day as well only to find out that the community on ruby on rails is mostly linux based and doing the things without ubuntu could be really difficult, experienced this & hence I downloaded Ubuntu and to my surprise the app was still not running 
- Day 4 - Discarded all my previous try and created a new ruby on rails app from scratch and boom it was working as the ruby version installed in the given github repo was og 3.0.2 and all the dependencies were failing back to back because of that and i had a version of ruby 3.0.3 hence i created the new rails app, I did tried using rbenv as well for multiple ruby versions but still it did not work.
- Day 5/ Day 6 - Finally started working on the project, the whole experience was very much exciting and i am glad i did not give up at any point of time.
